# claude-test

This sample application was built with Claude Code and runs on a locally hosted Ollama instance.  

The project was generated using [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs) and leverages a [local Ollama server](https://github.com/mmontes11/k8s-ai/tree/main/infrastructure/ollama) deployed in my [homelab](https://github.com/mmontes11/k8s-infrastructure).  

Follow the [integration guide](https://docs.ollama.com/integrations/claude-code) to configure Claude to work with your local Ollama installation.
