This sample application was built with Claude Code and runs on a locally hosted Ollama instance.  

The project was generated using [Opencode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) and leverages a [local Ollama server](https://github.com/mmontes11/k8s-ai/tree/main/infrastructure/ollama) deployed in my [homelab](https://github.com/mmontes11/k8s-infrastructure).
